===============================

My submission for Project 3 of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

To run, clone the repo and open index.html in your web browser of choice.

How To Play
-----------

To play, use the arrow keys to move the player character.  Upon reaching the
water or getting hit by a bug, the game will reset.  Avoid the bugs, with the
goal of crossing the road and reaching the water and winning the game!
